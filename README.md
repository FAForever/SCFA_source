# Forged Alliance Source Code

This repository was the [FAForever aprils fools prank 2024](https://forum.faforever.com/topic/8990/april-fools-the-day-has-come-we-have-the-source-code).

It contained a modified copy of the original [Command & Conquer Generals repository](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour) with renamed folders. Then - with some creative ChatGPT texting - we added a bunch of fake commit messages without actually changing any files (just whitespace).

To avoid confusion and breaking the original licensing, we removed this modified copy. But:

We don't want you to leave with nothing, so here still keep the script that generated the fake commits. Happy pranking!

PS: The original source code is most probably lost forever. We tried to acquire it. All game industry contacts claim they don't have it anymore.
